# Stage 2: Semi-minimal runtime image - contains only built files and minimal dependencies for the RH certification

# To achieve a hermetic build with minimal container size, you can request an exception for the image to use a base image 
# other than ubi-minimal. This will allow you to use a smaller base image like scratch or alpine.

# Alternatively, you can use the `docker-build-multi-platform-oci-ta` pipeline, which supports building multi-arch 
# container images while maintaining trust after pipeline customization. This pipeline uses OCI artifacts instead of 
#Persistent Volume Claims, which may help reduce the container size.

# You can also take a look at the workarounds:supportRedHatImageVersion preset for other available options.
